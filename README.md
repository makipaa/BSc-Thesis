The source code contains implemention of hyperparameter tuning, variable selection and model validation (cross-validation). The preprocessing function needs to be modified to match the dataset needs. Also it is important to change the training and test dataset split date accordingly (e.g so hyperparameter tuning has the same split ratio as the variable selection etc.). More information on how the functions operate are commented in the code.
